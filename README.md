Ledokku is a beautiful UI powered by [dokku](http://dokku.viewdocs.io/dokku/)

With us you will be able to deploy apps written in:
**node.js, php, ruby and many more**.

And link them with wide most popular dbs : **postgresql, mongodb, redis**.

## Just few clicks in within and your app is live

- Install Ledokku on your Dokku server
- Select which app you want to deploy from Github
- Create and link your db (PostgreSQL, mongoDB, redis)
- Link your custom domain
- App is live 🎉🎉🎉

## Our vision

We started to work on this because current deployment solutions were expensive or hard to configure. With Ledokku we plan to provide a solution were deployment experience is smooth, enjoyable and affordable.

## MVP

To get initial feedback we are working the MVP state where current Dokku users will be able to use the web ui of Ledokku while keeping control on their server. It will allow us to gather feedback from active Dokku users and shape the future of Ledokku.
