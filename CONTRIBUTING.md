# Contributing to ledokku

## Requirements

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) 12.0.0+
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/) 1.2.0+
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and docker compose installed.

## Pull Requests

For non-bug-fixes, please open an issue first and discuss your idea to make sure we're on the same page.

**Before submitting a pull request**, please make sure the following is done:

- Fork the repository and create a new branch from `master`.
- Must not break the test suite (`yarn test`). If you're fixing a bug, include a test that would fail without your fix.
- Must be formatted with prettier (`yarn prettier`).
- Must be **isolated**. Avoid grouping many, unrelated changes in a single PR.

## Development Workflow

To setup the project locally you first need to fork the project on Github (top right on the project page). Then clone the project: `git clone git@github.com:yourname/ledokku`. Now you can run `yarn` to install the dependencies.

### Creating a new OAuth App

In your browser open https://github.com/settings/developers and click on the "New OAuth App" button.

Add a name, a homepage url, and in the field "Authorization callback URL" set the value to "http://localhost:3000/". Then click the "Register application" button. You should now be able to see the client id and client secret of the app.

### Setup environment variables

We use [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) to loads environment variables from a `.env` file.

Let's first setup the client environment. Inside the `client` folder create a new `.env` file and add the following env variables (replace the `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` value with the one you obtained when creating the Github OAuth App):

```
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID="MY_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID_CREATE_AT_THE_PREVIOUS_STEP"
SERVER_URL="http://localhost:4000"
```

Let's now setup the server environment. Inside the `server` folder create a new `.env` file and add the following env variables (replace the github id and secret with the one you obtained when creating the Github OAuth App):

```
DATABASE_URL="postgres://postgres:postgrespassword@localhost:5433/postgres"
REDIS_URL="redis://127.0.0.1:6380"
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID="MY_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID_CREATE_AT_THE_PREVIOUS_STEP"
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET="MY_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET_CREATE_AT_THE_PREVIOUS_STEP"
JWT_SECRET="strong-secret"
```

Finally we also need to create a `.env` file for prisma. Inside the `server/prisma` folder create a new `.env` file and add the following env variable:

```
DATABASE_URL="postgres://postgres:postgrespassword@localhost:5433/postgres"
```

### Starting the databases

In your terminal, run `docker-compose up` from the root folder of the repository to start the database services required to run the app.

### Apply the latest migrations

To apply the latest migrations to the PostgreSQL database, in the `server` folder run `yarn prisma migrate up --experimental`.

### Starting the application

Inside the `server` folder run `yarn dev` to start the server. The server should now be listening incoming requests on port 4000.

Inside the `client` folder run `yarn dev` to start the next.js client app. The client should now be listening incoming requests on port 3000.

You can now open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to see the app running.

## Style Guide

To format the code automatically we use [prettier](https://prettier.io/). Run `yarn prettier` after making any changes to the code.
