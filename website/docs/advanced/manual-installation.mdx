:::note
You need to run the following steps on a dokku server.
If you do not have a dokku server for now, please follow [the getting started guide](/docs/getting-started).
:::

First we need to create a new app for ledokku.

```sh
dokku apps:create ledokku
```

To keep the same ssh key when you update ledokku we need to create a persistent storage for the ssh key.

```sh
mkdir /var/lib/dokku/data/storage/ledokku-ssh/
chown dokku:dokku /var/lib/dokku/data/storage/ledokku-ssh/
dokku storage:mount ledokku /var/lib/dokku/data/storage/ledokku-ssh/:/root/.ssh
```

Create a new Redis database.

```sh
# If the Redis plugin is not installed on your server run, otherwise skip this command
sudo dokku plugin:install https://github.com/dokku/dokku-redis.git redis
```

```sh
dokku redis:create ledokku
dokku redis:link ledokku ledokku
```

Create a new Postgres database.

```sh
# If the Postgres plugin is not installed on your server run, otherwise skip this command
sudo dokku plugin:install https://github.com/dokku/dokku-postgres.git postgres
```

```sh
dokku postgres:create ledokku
dokku postgres:link ledokku ledokku
```

In your browser open https://github.com/settings/developers and click on the "New OAuth App" button.

Add a name, a homepage url, and in the field "Authorization callback URL" set the value to your ledokku ip address and port 4000. (eg: http://123.123.123.123:4000)

<img alt="Github Oauth app setup" src={useBaseUrl('/img/githubApp.png')} />

Then click the "Register application" button. You should now be able to see the client id and client secret of the app. Let's add them to the ledokku config.

```sh
dokku config:set ledokku GITHUB_CLIENT_ID="MY_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID"
dokku config:set ledokku GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET="MY_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET"
```

Now that github is configured let's add the missing env variables we need.

```sh
dokku config:set ledokku DOKKU_SSH_HOST="MY_SERVER_IP"
dokku config:set ledokku JWT_SECRET="SUPER_SECURE_SECRET"
```

Now pull the latest version of ledokku from the docker registry and tag it.

```sh
docker pull ledokku/ledokku:0.1.0
docker tag ledokku/ledokku:0.1.0 dokku/ledokku:0.1.0
```

Finally we deploy the tag to start our ledokku server.

```sh
dokku tags:deploy ledokku 0.1.0
```

:::note
Before setting up the domain DNS in order to verify that the installation was successful, we need to open the port 4000. To do so, run the following command:

```sh
sudo ufw allow 4000
```

:::

Now open you server ip in your browser with the port 4000 (eg: http://123.123.123.123:4000).

You should be able to see the ledokku admin üéâ.

:::note
We saw that the server is running properly, so we can remove the rule from the firewall.

```sh
sudo ufw deny 4000
```

:::

Congrats, the ledokku app is running on your server üëè.

We are preparing some documentation to show you how to setup a custom domain name and deploy your first app.
In the meantime, to deploy your first app please take a look at the dokku official documentation http://dokku.viewdocs.io/dokku/deployment/application-deployment/.
