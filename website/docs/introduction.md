## Our vision

We started to work on this because current deployment solutions were expensive or hard to configure. With Ledokku we plan to provide a solution were deployment experience is smooth, enjoyable and affordable.

## MVP

To get initial feedback we are working the MVP state where current Dokku users will be able to use the web ui of Ledokku while keeping control on their server. It will allow us to gather feedback from active Dokku users and shape the future of Ledokku.

## MVP features

- Beautiful web ui
- Common app management (create, delete, stop)
- Env variables management (set, unset, edit)
- Databases management (create, delete, link)
- Explore app logs
