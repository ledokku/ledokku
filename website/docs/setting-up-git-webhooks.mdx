Follow this guide to set up git webhooks for your app and
enjoy the benefits of auto deployments based on changes in your main branch.

### Getting webhooks secret

Go to your app settings view and find your webhooks secret as seen in screenshot below

<img
  alt="Ledokku app settings"
  src={useBaseUrl('/img/ledokku_app_settings.png')}
/>

### Github repository webhooks setup

Go to your repositories settings on Github

Head to webhooks section

And once you see this screen, click on **Add webhook**

<img
  alt="Github webhooks settings view"
  src={useBaseUrl('/img/webhooks_settings.png')}
/>

After that you will be redirected to the actual webhooks setup screen.

<img
  alt="Github webhooks setup view"
  src={useBaseUrl('/img/webhooks_setup.png')}
/>

Where you should do following steps :

- Enter **YOUR_DOMAIN/webhooks** or **YOUR_SERVER_PUBLIC_IP/webhooks** as Payload URL
- Change Content type to **application/json**
- Enter your webhooks secret from [above](#getting-webhooks-secret)
- Click **Add webhook** and voila!

You will be redirected back to webhooks settings screen with your webhook listed
there. Click on it and scroll below to look for **recent deliveries** section.

At this point you should have one successfully sent webhook with ✅ on the right side.
That's called a ping event and it works sort of as a test to verify that your setup works.

If you see ❌ , then click on item to see more and if you are sure that you followed steps correctly,
but it still doesn't work, feel free to reach out to us via Twitter or Github issues.

### Testing webhooks

To make sure that your app indeed is being redeployed when new commit is pushed to your main
branch, try commiting and pushing something.

You should see another ✅ in the list of **recent deliveries** and
after clicking on it you will see more info about the actual event which have very explicit
information about your branch and most recent commit.

App itself will be redeploying and actual changes will be available once deployment is over, which usually takes couple of minutes. Until
the process is finished your current version will be running guaranteeing you 0 downtime.
