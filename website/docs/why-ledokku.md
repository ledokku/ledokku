### Ledokku in comparison to other tools

_*Name sounds cool, visuals are great, but how Ledokku is different from other deployment platforms?*_ This so far
has been the most common reaction from people who have been introduced to Ledokku.

Before we dive into comparisons, couple of disclaimers: _We at Ledokku ❤️ Vercel and Netlify as for our platform we use Next.js which is framework created by Vercel and our docs are hosted on Netlify._

### Vercel

Ledokku is more flexible than Vercel as it allows you to deploy apps written in any of the most popular programming languages and link them any of the most popular databases. Where as Vercel is focusing just on JAMstack and serverless apps and certainly does it really well.

### Netlify

Ledokku is more flexible than Netlify as it allows you to deploy apps written in any of the most popular programming languages and link them any of the most popular databases. Similarly to Vercel, Netlify is focusing just on JAMstack static apps and also does it really well.

### Render

Ledokku is cheaper than Render. In terms of offering languages in which you can deploy, Render has a wider offering than Ledokku as apart from the most popular languages you can deploy Rust and Elixir apps with them as well.

### Heroku

Ledokku is cheaper than Heroku and provides very similar functionality as it runs on herokuish.
