:::note
You need to run the following steps on a dokku server.
If you do not have a dokku server for now, please follow [the getting started guide](/docs/getting-started).
:::

```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ledokku/ledokku/v0.3.0/ledokku-bootstrap.sh
sudo bash ledokku-bootstrap.sh
```

Congrats, the ledokku app is running on your server 👏.

We are preparing some documentation to show you how to setup a custom domain name and deploy your first app.
In the meantime, to deploy your first app please take a look at the dokku official documentation http://dokku.viewdocs.io/dokku/deployment/application-deployment/.

> If you prefer you can also [install ledokku manually on your server](/docs/advanced/manual-installation).
