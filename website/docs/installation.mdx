### Run ledokku install script

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ledokku/ledokku/v0.7.0/ledokku-bootstrap.sh
sudo bash ledokku-bootstrap.sh
```

Congrats, the ledokku app is running on your server 👏.

We are preparing some documentation to show you how to setup a custom domain name and deploy your first app.
In the meantime, to deploy your first app please take a look at the dokku official documentation https://dokku.com/docs/deployment/application-deployment/.

> If you prefer you can also [install ledokku manually on your server](/docs/advanced/manual-installation).
