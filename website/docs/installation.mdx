:::note
You need to run the following steps on a dokku server.
If you do not have a dokku server for now, please follow [the getting started guide](/docs/getting-started).
:::

### Run ledokku install script

```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ledokku/ledokku/v0.7.0/ledokku-bootstrap.sh
sudo bash ledokku-bootstrap.sh
```

Congrats, the ledokku app is running on your server 👏.

We are preparing some documentation to show you how to setup a custom domain name and deploy your first app.
In the meantime, to deploy your first app please take a look at the dokku official documentation https://dokku.com/docs/deployment/application-deployment/.

> If you prefer you can also [install ledokku manually on your server](/docs/advanced/manual-installation).

### Configure dokku

1. In order to be able to access our dokku server, we update the server Firewall Rules to allow all incoming HTTP and HTTPS requests.

```sh
sudo ufw allow proto tcp from any to any port 80,443
```

2. Open http://YOUR_DOCKER_DROPLET_IP in browser
   You will see dokku webUI with SSH key already there

You will need to set up the domain name and put tickbox in `Use virtual host naming for apps`

<img alt="Dokku Web UI Setup" src={useBaseUrl('/img/dokkuWebUi.png')} />

If set up is successful, you will be redirected to dokku home page.
