:::note
You need to run the following steps on a dokku server.
If you do not have a dokku server for now, please follow [the getting started guide](/docs/getting-started).
:::

### Github OAuth setup

In your browser open https://github.com/settings/developers and click on the "New OAuth App" button.

Add a name, a homepage url, and in the field "Authorization callback URL" set the value to your ledokku ip address. (eg: http://123.123.123.123)

<img alt="Github Oauth app setup" src={useBaseUrl('/img/githubApp.png')} />

Then click the "Register application" button. You should now be able to see the client id and client secret of the app. Let's add them to the ledokku config.

### Run ledokku install script

```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ledokku/ledokku/v0.5.0/ledokku-bootstrap.sh
sudo bash ledokku-bootstrap.sh
```

Congrats, the ledokku app is running on your server 👏.

We are preparing some documentation to show you how to setup a custom domain name and deploy your first app.
In the meantime, to deploy your first app please take a look at the dokku official documentation https://dokku.com/docs/deployment/application-deployment/.

> If you prefer you can also [install ledokku manually on your server](/docs/advanced/manual-installation).
