### Overview

To get started with Ledokku you will have to set up your own server. If you already
have experience with installing and running dokku, please skip the part below proceed directly to [**installation guide**](installation.mdx).

If you want to try out Ledokku and need guidance on how to set up your own server and install dokku on it, please follow these steps.

- [Set up Digital Ocean account](#set-up-digital-ocean-account-and-get-100-credit)
- [Create Docker Droplet](#create-docker-droplet)
- [SSH into Digital Ocean Droplet](#ssh-into-digital-ocean-droplet)
- [Install dokku on your Droplet](#install-dokku-on-your-droplet)
- [Proceed to next page for further instructions](#proceed-to-next-page-to-install-ledokku)

### Set up Digital Ocean account and get $100 credit

First you will need to open a Digital Ocean account and we recommend you do it with this [**link**](https://m.do.co/c/35f78321cb42) as it will it bring you **$100 free credit** to play around for the first 60 days. More than enough to try out Ledokku.

### Create Docker Droplet

In Digital Ocean server's are referred as droplets and in our case we will
be creating Docker Droplet to host our dokku apps on.

1. Expand the **_Discover_** section on left side menu
2. Click **_Marketplace_**
3. Search for **_Docker_**

<img

  src={useBaseUrl('/img/searchDroplet.png')}
/>

4. Click **_Create Docker droplet_**

<img
  alt="Create one click droplet"
  src={useBaseUrl('/img/createDroplet.png')}
/>

5. Select **_Starter Plan_**
   It shows $5/month, but to play around with Ledokku for a day or couple of days will most 
likely cost you under $0.50 and you will be charged just that and no more. After that scroll down for SSH setup.

6. Choose existing SSH key
   If you already had previously set up SSH on Digital Ocean then choose one of your
   existing SSH keys. As you can see in screenshot, existing SSH key called **_Ledokku_** is selected. If you click New SSH key, see step 7.

7. Set up new SSH key
   See the instructions in the input field. That should be enough for you to get through this setup.

8. Click green **_CREATE A DROPLET_** button.

### SSH into Digital Ocean Droplet

1. Open terminal of your choice

2. Run this command

Before running the command, don't forget to change YOUR_DOCKER_DROPLET_IP part to the
ip address you can see as your Droplet IP in your Digital Ocean's dashboard.

```sh
ssh root@YOUR_DOCKER_DROPLET_IP
```

<img alt="Docker droplet ip" src={useBaseUrl('/img/dockerIp.png')} />

3. After running this command you will be asked whether you are sure that you want to connect
   to this server and to this prompt you should type `yes` and click `ENTER`

4. In your terminal you will see that you are inside the docker droplet <br/>
   Your terminal path will look something similar to this `root@YOUR_DROPLET_NAME:~#`

### Install dokku on your Droplet

From your Docker Droplet run these commands :

```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dokku/dokku/v0.21.4/bootstrap.sh
sudo DOKKU_TAG=v0.21.4 bash bootstrap.sh
```

### Configure dokku

1. In order to be able to access our dokku server, we update the server Firewall Rules to allow all incoming HTTP and HTTPS requests.

```sh
sudo ufw allow proto tcp from any to any port 80,443
```

2. Open http://YOUR_DOCKER_DROPLET_IP in browser
   You will see dokku webUI with SSH key already there

You will need to set up the domain name and put tickbox in `Use virtual host naming for apps`

<img alt="Dokku Web UI Setup" src={useBaseUrl('/img/dokkuWebUi.png')} />

If set up is successful, you will be redirected to dokku home page.
